Tasks

#### [0. Double the number of webservers](https://github.com/cbayonao/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x0F-load_balancer/0-custom_http_response-header)
Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 0-custom_http_response-header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task
#### [1. Install your load balancer](https://github.com/cbayonao/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x0F-load_balancer/1-install_load_balancer)
Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.
#### [2. Add a custom HTTP header with Puppet](https://github.com/cbayonao/holberton-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x0F-load_balancer/2-puppet_custom_http_response-header.pp)
Just as in task #0, weâ€™d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.
