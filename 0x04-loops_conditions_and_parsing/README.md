       - if the file is not empty: holbertonschool file is not empty
       - if the file is a regular file: holbertonschool is a regular file
       - if the file is not a regular file: (nothing)

    - Format: The user USERNAME is part of the GROUP_ID gang, lives in HOME_DIRECTORY and rides COMMAND/SHELL. USER ID's place is protected by the passcode PASSWORD, more info about the user here: USER ID INFO

13. Let's parse Apache logs

      - You are not allowed to use while, for, until and cut
      - Download and commit the apache-access.log file along with your answers files
14. Dig the data
    - Using what you did in the previous exercise, write a Bash script that groups visitors by IP and HTTP status code, and displays this data.
    - Requirements:
      - The exact format must be:

	- In list format
      - Ordered from the greatest to the lowest number of occurrences
      	- See example (Intranet)
